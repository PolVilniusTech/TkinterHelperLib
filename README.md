# TkinterHelperLib - Carly Freedman
This is a Pypi library for those who are not familiar with tkinter or who have not made a GUI before or just want their code to be more than just a boring black screen but are not really interested in UX Design.

Download here or using the following command:
pip install tkinterHelperLib


When I first got into programming I remember being very frustrated because I never wanted to learn any complicated GUI or UX skills but showing off my programs in a DOS fashion was just ...unimpressive. Also, adding a UI really helped me advance my programming skills because you can have several 'pages' open at once and it expanded the options for what my programs could do. Hopefully this can help someone who was in my same position.

At the moment, the library is made up of four functions which are listed and described below. I plan to update and expand the library soon. My next update should include the addWidget function allowing a type 'entry'. Let me know if you have any ideas for updates!(:
